---

## Specialized Agents

### Created Agents

#### 1. ticket-analyzer.md (14KB, ~450 lines)

**Removes**: 300-400 lines from each command

**Capabilities**:
- Parse ticket files (INIT, EPIC, STORY, TASK)
- Score completeness (Initiative: 8 criteria, Epic: 10, Story: 14, Task: 10)
- Validate hierarchy relationships
- Detect progress/status inconsistencies
- Compare sibling tickets for quality

**Used By**: `/start-next-task`, `/write-next-tickets`, `/review-story`

---

#### 2. design-guardian.md (17KB, ~550 lines)

**Removes**: 250 lines from each command

**Capabilities**:
- Detect unnecessary abstraction (single implementation)
- Flag premature optimization (no metrics)
- Identify unnecessary caching (small files, CLI tools)
- Distinguish valid complexity from overengineering

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Caching for <10KB files
- ❌ Interfaces with only one implementation
- ❌ Performance optimization before metrics
- ❌ Large refactors when targeted fixes work

**Valid Complexity** (won't flag):
- ✅ Security hardening
- ✅ Type safety and validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Test coverage improvements

**Used By**: `/write-next-tickets`, `/review-story`, `/start-next-task`

---

#### 3. git-state-analyzer.md (15KB, ~480 lines)

**Removes**: 150-200 lines from each command

**Capabilities**:
- Parse git commit history
- Analyze file changes
- Compare task statuses to commit evidence
- Detect ticket drift
- Validate progress percentages

**Used By**: `/review-story`, `/start-next-task`

---

#### 4. specification-quality-checker.md (14KB, ~470 lines)

**Removes**: 100-150 lines from each command

**Capabilities**:
- Detect vague terms (handle, support, manage, simple, basic)
- Find missing details (TBD, etc., as needed)
- Identify implicit assumptions (obviously, clearly)
- Flag unquantified requirements (fast, efficient)
- Score agent-executability

**Target**: 95%+ ambiguity score

**Used By**: `/write-next-tickets`, `/review-story`, `/start-next-task`

---

#### 5. pattern-discovery.md (17KB, ~540 lines)

**Removes**: 200-300 lines from each command

**Capabilities**:
- Catalog test fixtures (conftest.py files)
- Identify test patterns (AAA, parametrization, mocking)
- Find E2E step definitions
- Discover source code utilities and helpers
- Extract documented anti-patterns
- Calculate pattern reuse score (0-10)

**Discovery Types**:
- full-survey
- focused-domain
- fixture-lookup
- test-pattern-search

**Used By**: `/start-next-task`, `/write-next-tickets`

---

#### 6. requirements-interviewer.md (25KB, ~800 lines)

**Removes**: 400-500 lines from each command

**Capabilities**:
- Progressive questioning (high-level → details → validation)
- Ticket-type-specific question templates
- Probe vague responses until concrete
- Reflect understanding back to user
- Preserve user's exact language
- Detect and challenge overengineering
- Calculate completeness score (target: 95%+)

**Interview Types**:
- Initiative interview
- Epic interview
- Story interview
- Task interview

**Used By**: `/write-next-tickets`

## Migration Guide

### For Users

**No Breaking Changes**: Commands work identically from user perspective.

**What's Different** (internal only):
- Commands now invoke specialized agents
- Analysis is more thorough and consistent
- Agent outputs are reusable across commands

**What to Expect**:
- Same inputs, same outputs
- Possibly more reliable (agents focus on one thing)
- Slightly different internal flow (parallel agent invocations)

### For Developers

**Using Agents in New Commands**:

1. **Invoke via Task Tool**:
```markdown
Use Task tool (general-purpose) with {agent-name}:

**Agent Type**: {agent-name}
{Input fields per agent specification}

Execute the analysis now.
```

2. **Store Output**:
```markdown
Store output as `VARIABLE_NAME`
```

3. **Aggregate Results**:
```markdown
Combine outputs from multiple agents
Present aggregated analysis to user
```

4. **Use Recommendations**:
```markdown
Apply agent recommendations in actions
```

**See**: `.claude/agents/README.md` for detailed patterns and examples

---

## Performance Impact

### Context Size

**Before**: 5,660 lines across 4 commands
**After**: 3,139 lines across 4 commands + 3,500 lines in 6 reusable agents

**Net**: Commands are 45% smaller, agents are reusable

### Execution Time

**No significant change**:
- Agent invocations replace inline analysis
- Parallel invocations where possible
- Similar overall execution time

### Reliability

**Improved**:
- Smaller context per command = less hallucination risk
- Focused agents = more consistent analysis
- Clear input/output contracts = predictable behavior

---

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Maintainability

**Before**: Update analysis logic in 3-4 places
**After**: Update one agent, all commands benefit

**Example**: Fix ticket completeness criteria
- Before: Edit 3 command files
- After: Edit `ticket-analyzer.md` once

### 2. Reusability

**Before**: Duplicate pattern discovery logic in multiple commands
**After**: Single `pattern-discovery` agent used by multiple commands

**Example**: Pattern reuse checking
- Before: Duplicated ~300 lines in 2 commands
- After: Single 540-line agent, referenced by both

### 3. Composability

**Before**: Monolithic, hard to mix analyses
**After**: Compose agents as needed

**Example**: New command needs pattern discovery + complexity check
- Before: Copy logic from other commands (~500 lines)
- After: Invoke 2 agents (~40 lines)

### 4. Testability

**Before**: Hard to test analysis logic separately from orchestration
**After**: Agents can be tested independently

**Example**: Test overengineering detection
- Before: Run entire command, check output
- After: Invoke `design-guardian` with test input, validate output

### 5. Clarity

**Before**: Commands mix orchestration and analysis
**After**: Clear separation of concerns

**Example**: Understanding what a command does
- Before: Read 2000 lines of mixed logic
- After: Read orchestration flow (~600 lines) + reference agents

---

## Breaking Changes

**None**: All refactored commands maintain identical user-facing behavior.

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential New Agents

1. **test-coverage-analyzer**: Analyze test coverage gaps
2. **dependency-validator**: Check dependency versions and conflicts
3. **documentation-generator**: Auto-generate docs from code/tickets
4. **roadmap-aligner**: Validate work aligns with roadmap timeline

### Potential Command Improvements

1. `/review-pr-comments`: Could use `pattern-discovery` for fix suggestions
2. New command: `/validate-pr` using multiple agents before creating PR
3. New command: `/suggest-refactoring` using agents to find improvement opportunities

---

## Rollback Plan
