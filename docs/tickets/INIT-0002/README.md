# INIT-0002: Intelligence Layer

**Timeline**: Q1 2026  
**Status**: ðŸ”µ Not Started  
**Owner**: TBD  
**Progress**: â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ 0%

## Objective

Enhance search with AI-powered context optimization and intelligent reranking. Transform basic vector search into an intelligent context assembly system that understands code relationships and provides comprehensive, relevant context for coding tasks.

## Key Results

- [ ] Multi-source context aggregation implemented
- [ ] GPT-5-Codex reranking improving relevance by >30%
- [ ] Token budget management keeping context within LLM limits
- [ ] Automated quality metrics showing >0.6 semantic density

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Context includes code, tests, and git history
- [ ] Results reranked by relevance
- [ ] Token budgets respected
- [ ] Source attribution clear

### Performance Targets

- Semantic density: >0.6 (relevant content ratio)
- Source diversity: >60% queries use multiple sources
- Reranking latency: <1s additional
- Token utilization: >80% of budget used effectively

### Quality Gates

- Integration tests: Multi-source aggregation tested
- Benchmarks: Canonical queries meet targets
- Cost analysis: Per-query cost <$0.10
- Documentation: Architecture documented

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites

- INIT-0001 completed (MVP Foundation)
- Basic search functionality working
- Cost tracking implemented

### External Services

- OpenAI GPT-5-Codex for reranking
- LangSmith for LLM observability

### Technology Stack

- LangChain for LLM orchestration
- LangGraph for workflow management
- tiktoken for token counting

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Reranking costs too high | High | Medium | Batch requests, cache results |
| Context exceeds LLM limits | Medium | Low | Smart truncation, summarization |
| Complexity hurts performance | Medium | Medium | Progressive enhancement |
| Poor reranking quality | High | Low | A/B testing, user feedback |

## Deliverables Checklist

### Context Assembly (EPIC-0002.1)

- [ ] Multi-source aggregator
- [ ] Test file discovery
- [ ] Git history integration
- [ ] Result deduplication
- [ ] Source weighting algorithm

### Performance Optimization (EPIC-0002.2)

- [ ] Request batching
- [ ] Result caching layer
- [ ] Parallel processing
- [ ] Index optimization
- [ ] Memory management

### Evaluation Framework (EPIC-0002.3)

- [ ] Canonical test suite
- [ ] Quality metrics tracking
- [ ] Regression detection
- [ ] Cost monitoring
- [ ] A/B testing framework

## Acceptance Criteria

The Intelligence Layer is complete when:

1. **Multi-Source Context Works**

   ```bash
   gitctx search "user authentication"
   # Returns code implementations
   # Includes related tests
   # Shows recent git commits
   ```

2. **Reranking Improves Quality**
   - Relevance scores increase by >30%
   - Top results consistently most relevant
   - User feedback positive

3. **Token Management Works**

   ```bash
   gitctx search "complex query" --max-tokens 4000
   # Respects token limit
   # Includes diverse sources
   # Indicates truncation if needed
   ```

4. **Metrics Meet Targets**
   - Semantic density >0.6
   - Source diversity >60%
   - Cost per query <$0.10

## Timeline

### Month 1: Context Assembly

- Week 1-2: Multi-source aggregation
- Week 3-4: Test and git integration

### Month 2: Optimization

- Week 5-6: Performance tuning
- Week 7-8: Caching and batching

### Month 3: Evaluation

- Week 9-10: Metrics framework
- Week 11-12: Testing and refinement

## Next Steps

1. Complete INIT-0001 first
2. Design detailed architecture
3. Set up LangSmith monitoring
4. Create canonical test repositories

## Notes

- Build incrementally - basic aggregation first
- Monitor costs closely during development
- Use A/B testing to validate improvements
- Consider fallback to basic search if reranking fails
