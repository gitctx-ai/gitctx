# STORY-0001.5.4: LangSmith Integration & Prompt Evals

**Parent Epic**: [EPIC-0001.5](../README.md)
**Status**: 🔵 Not Started
**Story Points**: 5
**Progress**: ░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

## User Story

As a developer
I want prompt performance evaluation infrastructure with LangSmith
So that I can measure and optimize AI feature quality (accuracy, relevance, cost, latency)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] LangSmith SDK integrated and configured
- [ ] Eval metrics defined for core use cases:
  - Accuracy (correctness of results)
  - Relevance (semantic similarity to ground truth)
  - Cost (API token usage per query)
  - Latency (time to completion)
- [ ] Baseline measurements established for current prompts
- [ ] CI integration for prompt regression detection
- [ ] Eval caching implemented (avoid redundant API calls)
- [ ] Budget alerts configured (cost monitoring)
- [ ] Documentation: Eval development workflow guide

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites:**
- STORY-0001.5.1 (Infrastructure) - ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE FIRST (needs performance measurement patterns)
- EPIC-0001.3 (Search) - Complete ✅ (provides prompts to evaluate)

**Blocks:**
- Future AI features (RAG, code generation, summarization, etc.)

## Technical Notes

- LangSmith provides prompt versioning, tracing, and evaluation
- Eval types:
  - Unit evals: Test specific prompt behaviors (e.g., "extracts function signature correctly")
  - Integration evals: Test end-to-end workflows (e.g., "search → context → answer")
  - Regression evals: Detect quality degradation on new commits
- Cost management:
  - Cache eval results (avoid re-running expensive evals)
  - Limit eval frequency (not every commit)
  - Budget alerts (e.g., >$10/day triggers warning)
- CI integration:
  - Run evals on schedule (daily) or manually (workflow_dispatch)
  - Store results as GitHub Actions artifacts
  - Fail CI if critical metrics regress (e.g., accuracy drops >5%)

## Tasks

**Note:** Full task breakdown via `/plan-story STORY-0001.5.4`

Estimated tasks:
1. Install and configure LangSmith SDK
2. Define eval metrics and test cases
3. Establish baseline measurements
4. Implement eval caching
5. Add CI integration for regression detection
6. Configure budget alerts
7. Write eval development workflow guide

## Future Scope

This story prepares for future AI features:
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for code explanations
- Code generation with context
- Commit message summarization
- PR description generation
- Code review suggestions
