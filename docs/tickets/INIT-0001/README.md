# INIT-0001: MVP Foundation

**Timeline**: Q4 2025
**Status**: ðŸš§ In Progress
**Owner**: Core Team
**Progress**: â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘ ~38% (EPIC-0001.1 complete - 10/10 points, EPIC-0001.2 in progress - 9/25 points, 19/60 total points)

## Objective

Build the core functionality users need to search their codebase intelligently. Establish the foundation for a git-like CLI tool that provides semantic search capabilities with OpenAI embeddings and LanceDB vector storage.

## Key Results

- [ ] Complete CLI interface with all basic commands working
- [ ] Real indexing with OpenAI embeddings functional
- [ ] Vector search returning relevant results in <2 seconds
- [ ] Installation via pipx working smoothly

## Epics

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements

- â¬œ CLI responds to all commands
- â¬œ Repository indexing completes successfully
- â¬œ Search returns relevant results
- â¬œ Configuration management works

### Performance Targets

- Search latency: <2 seconds for 10K files
- Index speed: >100 files/minute
- Memory usage: <500MB during operation
- Startup time: <100ms

### Quality Gates

- BDD scenarios: 100% coverage for user features
- Unit tests: >90% code coverage
- Integration tests: All components tested
- Documentation: User guide complete

## Dependencies

### External Services

- OpenAI API for embeddings
- PyPI for package distribution

### Technology Stack

- Python 3.11+ (async support, type hints)
- Typer + Rich (CLI framework)
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-large
- LanceDB (vector storage)
- Safetensors (embedding storage)

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API costs exceed budget | High | Medium | Implement caching, cost tracking |
| Search latency too high | High | Low | Use indices, optimize queries |
| Complex installation | Medium | Low | pipx-only distribution |
| Poor search relevance | High | Medium | Iterate on embeddings, add reranking |

## Deliverables Checklist

- âœ… Main CLI structure with Typer
- âœ… Config command with persistent storage (STORY-0001.1.2 complete)
- âœ… Help system and documentation
- âœ… Error handling and user feedback
- âœ… Progress indicators with Rich

**Progress**: 10/10 story points complete (100%) âœ…

### Real Indexing (EPIC-0001.2)

- âœ… Commit graph walker with blob deduplication (STORY-0001.2.1 complete)
- â¬œ Smart text chunking with overlap (STORY-0001.2.2 - planned)
- â¬œ OpenAI embedding generation (STORY-0001.2.3 - planned)
- â¬œ LanceDB storage (STORY-0001.2.4 - planned)
- â¬œ Progress tracking and cost estimation (STORY-0001.2.5 - planned)

**Progress**: 9/25 story points complete (36%)

### Vector Search (EPIC-0001.3)

- â¬œ LanceDB integration
- â¬œ Query embedding generation
- â¬œ Similarity search implementation
- â¬œ Result ranking and formatting
- â¬œ Search performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is complete when:

1. **Installation Works**

   ```bash
   pipx install gitctx
   gitctx --version  # Shows version
   ```

2. **Configuration Works**

   ```bash
   gitctx config set api_keys.openai "sk-..."
   gitctx config get api_keys.openai  # Shows masked key
   ```

3. **Indexing Works**

   ```bash
   gitctx index
   # Shows progress bar
   # Completes without errors
   # Creates .gitctx/ directory
   # Creates safetensored code chunks
   # Creates vector store in lancedb
   ```

4. **Search Works**

   ```bash
   gitctx search "authentication"
   # Returns results in <2 seconds
   # Shows file:line references
   # Results are relevant
   ```

## Notes

- Focus on core functionality first, optimize later
- Use mocked implementations where possible for faster iteration
- Maintain BDD/TDD discipline throughout
- Track costs carefully during development
