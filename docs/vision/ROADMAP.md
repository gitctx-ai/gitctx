# gitctx Product Roadmap

## Executive Vision

### Problem Statement

Developers and AI coding agents fail to complete tasks effectively due to lack of project-specific context. Current tools either provide raw file search (grep/ag/rg) or simple semantic search without understanding the complete context needed for coding tasks.

### Solution

Build a focused, OpenAI-based context optimization engine with a git-like CLI interface. Use BDD/TDD to ensure quality from day one, with pytest-benchmark and LangSmith tracking metrics during development.

### Product Vision

**gitctx**: The intelligent context engine that understands your codebase like a senior developer, providing precisely the right context for any coding task.

### Success Metrics

See [success-metrics.md](success-metrics.md) for detailed KPIs and tracking.

## Development Philosophy

**Build the CLI first. Test everything. Ship working software continuously.**

1. **CLI-First Development**: Users can run commands immediately, even with mocked backends
2. **BDD for User Behavior**: Gherkin specifications define all user-facing features
3. **TDD for Implementation**: Unit tests written before code
4. **Continuous Evaluation**: Quality metrics integrated into test suite, not user commands

## Strategic Initiatives

- â¬œ Team collaboration features
- â¬œ Plugin architecture
- â¬œ Custom embeddings

## Core Commands

The user-facing interface that drives all interactions:

```bash
gitctx index                     # Index the repository
gitctx search "query"            # Search with context assembly
gitctx config set key value      # Manage configuration
gitctx clear                     # Clear cache and embeddings
```

## Development Methodology

See [BDD/TDD Workflow](../../CLAUDE.md#the-development-cycle) in the root CLAUDE.md for the mandatory development process.

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Language | Python 3.11+ | Async, type hints, performance |
| CLI | Typer + Rich | Git-like interface |
| Testing | pytest, pytest-bdd, pytest-benchmark | Comprehensive testing |
| LLM | Langchain/LangGraph/LangSmith | Abstraction and observability |
| Embeddings | OpenAI text-embedding-3-large | Best quality for baseline |
| Storage | Safetensors | 5x smaller than JSON |
| Vector DB | LanceDB | SQL capabilities, embedded |
| Models | GPT-5-Codex | Code-optimized |

### Core Design Principles

1. **Future Rust Optimization Support via Protocol-Based Design**
2. **OpenAI Only, But Use Langchain/LangGraph/LangSmith Everywhere**
3. **LanceDB for Storage Universally**
4. **Embeddings Persist to Repo, Database Does Not**
5. **Git-Inspired Text User Interface Design**
6. **Optimize for Context Quality, Not Search Results**
7. **Language-Agnostic by Design**

## Distribution Strategy

**gitctx will be distributed exclusively via pipx for isolated installation:**

```bash
pipx install gitctx
```

This ensures:

- Clean isolation from system Python packages
- No dependency conflicts with user projects
- Easy uninstallation with `pipx uninstall gitctx`
- Automatic virtual environment management

**Note**: Direct `pip install` is not supported. The package will be published to PyPI but designed for pipx installation only.
