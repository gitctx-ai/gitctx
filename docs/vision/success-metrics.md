## Implementation Reference

For detailed information on metrics implementation and testing:

### Testing & Coverage

- **BDD Testing**: See [tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md](../../tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md) for BDD scenario patterns
- **TDD & Unit Testing**: See [tests/unit/CLAUDE.md](../../tests/unit/CLAUDE.md) for unit test patterns and coverage
- **Coverage Configuration**: See [pyproject.toml](../../pyproject.toml) for coverage settings

### Performance Testing

- **Benchmarking**: See [tests/unit/CLAUDE.md](../../tests/unit/CLAUDE.md#performance-testing) for pytest-benchmark patterns
- **Performance Requirements**: See [docs/architecture/CLAUDE.md](../architecture/CLAUDE.md#performance-documentation) for targets

### Quality Gates

- **Tool Configuration**: See [pyproject.toml](../../pyproject.toml) for ruff, mypy, and coverage settings
- **Quality Commands**: See [Root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#quick-reference-commands) for quality gate commands

### Canonical Tests

- **Test Queries**: Defined during test implementation in BDD scenarios
- **Test Repositories**: Created as fixtures in test suites
- **Benchmark Suite**: Implemented using pytest-benchmark in unit tests

## How to Update Metrics

### Weekly Process

1. **Run Benchmarks**

   ```bash
   # Run performance benchmarks
   uv run pytest tests/benchmarks/ --benchmark-save=week-$(date +%Y%W)
   
   # Generate coverage report
   uv run pytest --cov=src/gitctx --cov-report=term
   ```

2. **Review Reports**
   - Check `.benchmarks/` directory for performance data
   - Review coverage report output
   - Note any regressions or improvements

3. **Update Dashboard**
   - Update the "Current" column in tables above
   - Change status indicators as appropriate:
     - ðŸ”µ Not Started
     - ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
     - ðŸŸ¢ Meeting Target
     - ðŸ”´ Below Target

4. **Track Trends**
   - Document significant changes in git commit messages
   - Create tickets for any metrics falling below targets

## Metric Definitions

### Coverage Metrics

- **BDD Coverage**: Percentage of user features with Gherkin scenarios
- **Unit Test Coverage**: Code coverage from unit tests
- **Integration Coverage**: End-to-end test coverage

### Performance Metrics

- **Search Latency**: 95th percentile response time for searches
- **CLI Response**: Time to parse and begin executing commands
- **Index Speed**: Files processed per minute during indexing
- **Memory Usage**: Peak RAM during typical operations
- **Startup Time**: Time from command invocation to ready state

### Quality Metrics

- **Semantic Density**: Ratio of relevant to total content returned
- **Source Diversity**: Percentage of results from multiple sources
- **Result Relevance**: Average relevance score of search results

### Efficiency Metrics

- **Cost per Query**: OpenAI API costs per search operation
- **Storage Efficiency**: Compression ratio with efficient storage formats
- **Token Utilization**: Percentage of token budget used effectively
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Percentage of queries served from cache
