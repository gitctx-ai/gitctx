# Story Review: Quality Validation + Ticket Synchronization

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive review of a story with dual capabilities:

1. **Quality Validation** (always): Check story completeness, coherence, alignment with roadmap
2. **Ticket Sync** (optional, in-progress only): Update tickets to match git reality

## Overall Workflow

1. **Gather User Context** - Ask if standard or focused review
2. **Verify Story Branch & Detect Mode** - Check branch, count commits
3. **Deep Analysis** - Use Task agent to analyze story quality + git state
4. **Present Combined Report** - Show quality score + issues + proposed edits
5. **Get User Approval** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED** - Present all edits and wait for approval
6. **Execute Edits** - Apply approved changes to ticket files
7. **Print Final Report** - Show improvements and next steps

---

## Step 0: Gather User Context

‚ö†Ô∏è **INITIAL PROMPT**

Before starting the review, ask the user what type of review they want:

```markdown
# üìã Story Review Setup

You're about to review the story on this branch.

**Review Options:**

1. **standard** - Complete quality validation + ticket sync
   - Checks all quality categories (completeness, hierarchy, roadmap alignment, etc.)
   - Validates ticket accuracy vs git commits (if in-progress)
   - Comprehensive but no specific focus

2. **focused** - Targeted review with your specific context
   - Same checks as standard, but prioritizes your concerns
   - You provide context about what to focus on
   - Agent highlights findings related to your focus areas

**Which type of review?** (standard/focused)
```

Wait for user response.

**If "standard":**
- Set `REVIEW_TYPE = "standard"`
- Set `USER_CONTEXT = ""`
- Proceed to Step 1

**If "focused":**
- Set `REVIEW_TYPE = "focused"`
- Ask follow-up:
  ```markdown
  **What should this review focus on?**

  Examples:
  - "Check if BDD scenarios match acceptance criteria"
  - "Validate task estimates are realistic"
  - "Ensure technical design is complete"
  - "Review new tasks added during implementation"

  Your focus (or press Enter for standard review):
  ```

  Wait for user input.
  - If user provides text: Set `USER_CONTEXT = <their input>`
  - If user presses Enter (empty): Treat as standard review
  - Proceed to Step 1

**If neither:**
- Ask again with validation: "Please choose 'standard' or 'focused'"

---

## Step 1: Verify Story Branch & Detect Mode

Check that we're on a story branch and determine mode:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Validation:**
- Branch name must match pattern `STORY-NNNN.N.N` (e.g., STORY-0001.1.2)
- If NOT on a story branch:
  - Ask user: "Not on a story branch. Current branch: [BRANCH]. Would you like to:"
    1. Create a new story branch (provide story ID)
    2. Switch to existing story branch (list available)
    3. Exit
  - Wait for user decision before proceeding

**Extract Story Info:**

From the branch name (e.g., `STORY-0001.1.2`), construct the necessary paths:

**Example for STORY-0001.1.2:**
- Story ID: `STORY-0001.1.2`
- Epic ID: `EPIC-0001.1` (first two numbers)
- Initiative ID: `INIT-0001` (first number)
- Story path: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/README.md`
- Epic path: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/README.md`
- Initiative path: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/README.md`

**Pattern:**
- For `STORY-NNNN.E.S`:
  - Initiative: `INIT-NNNN`
  - Epic: `EPIC-NNNN.E`
  - Story: `STORY-NNNN.E.S`
  - Story dir: `docs/tickets/INIT-NNNN/EPIC-NNNN.E/STORY-NNNN.E.S/`

**Detect Mode:**

```bash
# Count commits on current branch vs main
git rev-list --count main..HEAD
```

- **0 commits** ‚Üí `pre-work` mode (story not started)
- **N commits** ‚Üí `in-progress` mode (work underway)

---

## Step 2: Gather Context with Task Agent

Use the Task agent (general-purpose) to perform deep analysis:

```markdown
**Task Agent Prompt:**

Perform comprehensive story review combining quality validation and git reality analysis.

**Story Context:**
- Story ID: [STORY_ID from branch]
- Story path: docs/tickets/INIT-[NNNN]/EPIC-[NNNN.E]/STORY-[NNNN.E.S]/README.md
- Epic ID: EPIC-[NNNN.E]
- Epic path: docs/tickets/INIT-[NNNN]/EPIC-[NNNN.E]/README.md
- Initiative ID: INIT-[NNNN]
- Initiative path: docs/tickets/INIT-[NNNN]/README.md
- Mode: {pre-work | in-progress}

**IMPORTANT:** Construct paths from the branch name. For example, branch `STORY-0001.1.2` means:
- Initiative: INIT-0001
- Epic: EPIC-0001.1
- Story: STORY-0001.1.2

**Review Type:** {REVIEW_TYPE from Step 0}

{IF REVIEW_TYPE == "focused"}
**User Focus Context:**

{USER_CONTEXT from Step 0}

**Instructions:**
- Perform all standard validation checks
- Pay special attention to areas mentioned in user focus
- In your output, create a dedicated "Focus Area Analysis" section
- Highlight findings that directly relate to user's context
- Prioritize these findings in proposed edits
{ENDIF}

**Analysis Required:**

### Part 1: Quality Validation (ALWAYS)

**Read All Context Files:**
1. Story README: ${STORY_DIR}/README.md
2. All task files: ${STORY_DIR}/TASK-*.md
3. Parent epic: ${EPIC_DIR}/README.md
4. Sibling stories: All other STORY-${INIT}-${EPIC}.* in same epic directory
5. Initiative: ${INIT_DIR}/README.md
6. Roadmap: docs/vision/ROADMAP.md
7. Root CLAUDE.md and relevant nested CLAUDE.md files

**Validation Categories:**

#### 1. Story Completeness (10 checks)
- ‚úÖ User story follows "As a/I want/So that" format
- ‚úÖ All acceptance criteria are testable (not vague)
- ‚úÖ All child tasks listed and linked
- ‚úÖ Story points estimated and match task hours sum
- ‚úÖ BDD scenarios written in Gherkin (if applicable)
- ‚úÖ Technical design section present and detailed
- ‚úÖ Success metrics defined and measurable
- ‚úÖ Dependencies documented
- ‚úÖ Risks identified with mitigations
- ‚úÖ Example code/schemas provided for complex logic

#### 2. Hierarchy Consistency (6 checks base + 2 if in-progress)
- ‚úÖ Story aligns with parent epic's goals
- ‚úÖ Story doesn't duplicate sibling stories
- ‚úÖ Story contributes to epic's completion criteria
- ‚úÖ Story points fit within epic's total
- ‚úÖ Prerequisites from other stories identified
- ‚úÖ No conflicting assumptions with siblings
{IF in-progress}
- ‚úÖ New tasks (if any) align with story scope
- ‚úÖ Task additions documented in story progress/notes
{ENDIF}

#### 3. Roadmap Alignment (5 checks base + 1 if in-progress)
- ‚úÖ Story contributes to initiative objectives
- ‚úÖ Story aligns with version planning milestones
- ‚úÖ Story supports success metrics from roadmap
- ‚úÖ Story doesn't contradict core design principles
- ‚úÖ Technology choices match approved stack
{IF in-progress}
- ‚úÖ Scope changes (if any) align with roadmap priorities
{ENDIF}

#### 4. Implementation Readiness (10 checks base + 1 if in-progress)
- ‚úÖ Every task has concrete steps (not "implement X")
- ‚úÖ File paths and module names specified
- ‚úÖ BDD scenarios have corresponding step definitions planned
- ‚úÖ Test coverage targets specified (e.g., ‚â•85%)
- ‚úÖ Example code/pseudocode provided for complex logic
- ‚úÖ Edge cases identified in scenarios
- ‚úÖ Error handling paths specified
- ‚úÖ All external APIs/libraries identified
- ‚úÖ Solution complexity matches problem scope (not over-architected)
- ‚úÖ Tasks avoid premature optimization (implement MVP first, optimize when metrics show need)
{IF in-progress}
- ‚úÖ Implementation matches task specifications
{ENDIF}

**Anti-Overengineering Detection Patterns:**

For checks 9-10, flag issues when tasks propose complexity without clear justification:

- **Caching/Memoization** for:
  - Small files (<10KB) loaded once per process
  - CLI tools where each invocation is a new process
  - Data that changes frequently
  - No performance metrics showing it's needed

- **Abstraction Layers** when:
  - Only one concrete implementation exists
  - No indication multiple implementations will be needed
  - Adds complexity without solving a real problem
  - Uses terms like "future-proof" without roadmap evidence

- **Performance Optimizations** before:
  - Performance metrics exist showing a problem
  - Profiling data identifies the bottleneck
  - User-facing performance requirements exist
  - MVP implementation is complete

- **Premature Refactoring** such as:
  - Large refactors when targeted fixes would work
  - Breaking working code "for cleanliness" without quality threshold violations
  - Architectural changes without clear requirements driving them

**Valid Complexity** (do NOT flag):
- Security hardening (always appropriate)
- Type safety and validation (catches bugs early)
- Error handling for user-facing features
- Test coverage improvements
- Documentation
- Fixing actual quality threshold violations (complexity, line limits, etc.)

When flagging overengineering, propose specific edits like:
- Remove unnecessary task entirely
- Reduce task scope (e.g., "refactor entire module" ‚Üí "fix specific complexity violation")
- Move to future story with "if metrics show need" condition

#### 5. Specification Ambiguity Detection (8 checks)
- üîç Vague terms: "simple", "basic", "handle", "support", "improve"
- üîç Missing details: "TBD", "etc.", "and so on", "as needed"
- üîç Implicit assumptions: "obviously", "clearly", "simply"
- ÔøΩÔøΩ Unquantified requirements: "fast", "efficient", "user-friendly"
- üîç Missing acceptance criteria for edge cases
- üîç Incomplete error handling specifications
- üîç Missing validation rules
- üîç Newly added tasks with vague descriptions

{IF in-progress}
#### 6. Coherence Validation (6 checks - IN-PROGRESS MODE ONLY)
- üîç Git commits match story scope (no scope creep)
- üîç Completed tasks align with acceptance criteria
- üîç New tasks don't conflict with completed work
- üîç Task sequence makes logical sense
- üîç Progress percentage matches reality
- üîç Story status reflects actual state
{ENDIF}

**For Each Failed Check:**
- Document: Location (file:line), Current state, Issue description, Proposed fix, Impact/Priority

### Part 2: Ticket Sync Analysis (IN-PROGRESS MODE ONLY)

**Analyze Git State:**
- Committed changes: `git diff main...HEAD --stat`
- Committed changes detail: `git diff main...HEAD`
- Uncommitted changes: `git status --short`
- Uncommitted changes detail: `git diff`
- Recent commits: `git log --oneline main..HEAD`

**Compare Ticket vs Reality:**

For each task in the story:
- What does the task say it should accomplish?
- What files should be modified according to task description?
- Are those files actually modified in git diff?
- Are task checkboxes accurate?
- Is task status accurate (üîµ Not Started / üü° In Progress / ‚úÖ Complete)?
- Are actual hours recorded?

**Identify Ticket Drift:**
- Tasks marked incomplete but code is done
- Tasks marked complete but code is missing
- Progress percentages that don't match reality
- Missing context or documentation in tickets
- Status inconsistencies (task complete but story not updated)
- Parent epic/initiative progress bars out of sync
- New tasks added but not documented in story header
- Task additions not explained in story notes

**For Each Drift Item:**
- Specify: Which file needs updating (exact path), What section/field needs changing, Old value vs new value, Justification based on git diff

## Approval & Execution

{IF edits proposed}
**Do you approve these file edits?** (yes/no/modify)

Options:
- **yes**: Execute all proposed edits
- **no**: Skip all edits (issues documented for manual fix)
- **modify**: Discuss which edits to apply
{ELSE}
**No edits required - story is {ready | accurate}! ‚ú®**

{IF pre-work}
Proceed with starting work on TASK-${FIRST_TASK}.
{ELSE}
Continue with next pending task or create PR if story complete.
{ENDIF}
{ENDIF}
```

**CRITICAL:** Do not make any file edits until user explicitly approves with "yes".

---

## Step 4: Execute Edits (After Approval)

**Only proceed if:**
- User approved with "yes"
- Edits were proposed in Step 3

**Update Order:** (dependencies matter)
1. Task files (TASK-*.md) - lowest level
2. Story README.md - aggregates tasks
3. Epic README.md - aggregates stories
4. Initiative README.md - aggregates epics

**For Each Edit from Agent Analysis:**

Use the Edit tool with exact OLD and NEW strings from agent's "Proposed File Edits" section.

```python
# Example: Quality fix
Edit(
    file_path="docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/README.md",
    old_string="## Dependencies\n\n- Parent story created",
    new_string="## Dependencies\n\n- Requires STORY-0001.1.1 (CLI Framework) complete\n- Parent story created"
)

# Example: Ticket sync fix
Edit(
    file_path="docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/README.md",
    old_string="**Progress**: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 40% (2/5 tasks complete)",
    new_string="**Progress**: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 80% (4/5 tasks complete)"
)
```

**Error Handling:**
- If Edit fails (non-unique string), show error and ask user for guidance
- Continue with remaining edits even if one fails
- Track which edits succeeded vs failed

---

## Step 5: Print Final Report

Print a comprehensive report based on whether edits were made.

### Variant A: Edits Were Made

If edits were executed (came from Step 4):

```markdown

{ENDIF}
{ENDIF}

---

**Review completed! {‚ú® | Run again with approval to apply fixes.}**
```

## Important Notes

1. **Dual Validation**: Always check quality; add sync check if in-progress
2. **Single Approval Gate**: Present complete edit plan, get one approval, then execute all
3. **Update Order Matters**: Tasks ‚Üí Story ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Initiative (bottom-up)
4. **Quality Scoring**:
   - Pre-work: 5 categories, 39 total checks
   - In-progress: 6 categories, 49 total checks
   - Each category scored independently, average = overall score
5. **Edit Precision**: Use exact OLD/NEW strings from agent analysis
6. **Error Recovery**: Continue updates even if one fails, report all failures
7. **Mode Auto-Detection**: Based on commit count, no user input needed
8. **Flexibility**: User can decline edits and fix manually
9. **No File Creation**: This command only EDITS existing tickets, never creates

## Thresholds & Scoring

### Quality Score Interpretation
- 95-100%: Ready to start / Ready to continue
- 85-94%: Ready with minor issues
- 70-84%: Needs review before proceeding
- Below 70%: Not ready - significant work needed

### Edit Types

**Quality Fixes** (both modes):
- Add missing documentation sections
- Replace vague terms with concrete specifications
- Quantify unquantified requirements
- Add missing step definitions/examples
- Clarify ambiguous task descriptions

**Ticket Sync** (in-progress only):
- Update task statuses to match commits
- Adjust progress percentages
- Document new task additions
- Update parent epic/initiative progress
- Record actual hours worked

```

### Example 2: Focused Review

```bash
# User on story branch, pre-work
$ /review-story

# 0. Gather user context
Which type of review? (standard/focused)
> focused

What should this review focus on?
> Check if BDD scenarios match acceptance criteria and have step definitions planned

# 1. Verify branch & detect mode
Current branch: STORY-0001.1.3 ‚úì
Mode: pre-work (0 commits)

# 2. Launch Task agent with focus context
Analyzing story with focus on BDD scenarios...

# 3. Present combined report
# üìã Story Review Report: STORY-0001.1.3
# Review Type: Focused
# Focus Area: "Check if BDD scenarios match acceptance criteria and have step definitions planned"

## Focus Area Analysis

## Begin Execution

1. **Gather user context** - Ask standard vs focused, collect context if focused
2. **Verify branch & detect mode** - Check STORY-* branch, count commits
3. **Launch Task agent** - Analyze quality (always) + sync (if in-progress), with optional focus context
4. **Present combined report** - Show quality + sync + proposed edits (+ focus area if focused)
5. **Two paths:**
   - **If edits proposed**: Get approval ‚Üí Execute edits ‚Üí Print report (Variant A)
   - **If no edits OR user declines**: Print status report (Variant B)

**Remember:** Always present findings to user. Only make edits after explicit approval with "yes".
