# Story Review: Quality Validation + Ticket Synchronization

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive review of a story with dual capabilities:

1. **Quality Validation** (always): Check story completeness, coherence, alignment with roadmap
2. **Ticket Sync** (optional, in-progress only): Update tickets to match git reality

## Overall Workflow

1. **Gather User Context** - Ask if standard or focused review
2. **Verify Story Branch & Detect Mode** - Check branch, count commits
3. **Deep Analysis** - Invoke specialized agents for quality + git state analysis
4. **Present Combined Report** - Show quality score + issues + proposed edits
5. **Get User Approval** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED** - Present all edits and wait for approval
6. **Execute Edits** - Apply approved changes to ticket files
7. **Print Final Report** - Show improvements and next steps

---

## Step 0: Gather User Context

‚ö†Ô∏è **INITIAL PROMPT**

Before starting the review, ask the user what type of review they want:

```markdown
# üìã Story Review Setup

You're about to review the story on this branch.

**Review Options:**

1. **standard** - Complete quality validation + ticket sync
   - Checks all quality categories (completeness, hierarchy, roadmap alignment, etc.)
   - Validates ticket accuracy vs git commits (if in-progress)
   - Comprehensive but no specific focus

2. **focused** - Targeted review with your specific context
   - Same checks as standard, but prioritizes your concerns
   - You provide context about what to focus on
   - Agent highlights findings related to your focus areas

**Which type of review?** (standard/focused)
```

Wait for user response.

**If "standard":**
- Set `REVIEW_TYPE = "standard"`
- Set `USER_CONTEXT = ""`
- Proceed to Step 1

**If "focused":**
- Set `REVIEW_TYPE = "focused"`
- Ask follow-up:
  ```markdown
  **What should this review focus on?**

  Examples:
  - "Check if BDD scenarios match acceptance criteria"
  - "Validate task estimates are realistic"
  - "Ensure technical design is complete"
  - "Review new tasks added during implementation"

  Your focus (or press Enter for standard review):
  ```

  Wait for user input.
  - If user provides text: Set `USER_CONTEXT = <their input>`
  - If user presses Enter (empty): Treat as standard review
  - Proceed to Step 1

**If neither:**
- Ask again with validation: "Please choose 'standard' or 'focused'"

---

## Step 1: Verify Story Branch & Detect Mode

Check that we're on a story branch and determine mode:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

**Validation:**
- Branch name must match pattern `STORY-NNNN.N.N` or `plan/STORY-NNNN.N.N` (e.g., STORY-0001.1.2 or plan/STORY-0001.1.2)
- If NOT on a story branch:
  - Ask user: "Not on a story branch. Current branch: [BRANCH]. Would you like to:"
    1. Create a new story branch (provide story ID)
    2. Switch to existing story branch (list available)
    3. Exit
  - Wait for user decision before proceeding

**Extract Story Info:**

From branch `STORY-0001.1.2`:
- Story ID: `STORY-0001.1.2`
- Epic ID: `EPIC-0001.1` (first two numbers)
- Initiative ID: `INIT-0001` (first number)

**Construct paths:**
- Story dir: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/`
- Story README: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/README.md`
- Task pattern: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/STORY-0001.1.2/TASK-*.md`
- Epic README: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.1/README.md`
- Initiative README: `docs/tickets/INIT-0001/README.md`

**Detect Mode (pre-work vs in-progress):**

```bash
# Count commits on this branch
git rev-list --count main..HEAD
```

- If count == 0: `MODE = "pre-work"` (no commits yet, planning only)
- If count > 0: `MODE = "in-progress"` (has commits, can sync tickets)

Output:
```markdown
üìã Story Review: {STORY_ID}

**Mode**: {pre-work | in-progress}
{IF in-progress}
**Commits**: {count} commits on branch
{ENDIF}
**Review Type**: {standard | focused}
{IF focused}
**Focus**: {USER_CONTEXT}
{ENDIF}

Starting analysis...
```

## Step 2: Deep Analysis with Specialized Agents

Launch specialized agents in parallel for comprehensive analysis.

### 2.1 Invoke ticket-analyzer Agent

Use Task tool (general-purpose) with ticket-analyzer agent:

```markdown
You are the ticket-analyzer specialized agent. Analyze story and task quality.

**Analysis Type**: story-deep
**Target**: {STORY_ID from branch}
**Scope**: story-and-tasks
**Mode**: {pre-work | in-progress from commit count}

{IF REVIEW_TYPE == "focused"}
**Focus areas**: {USER_CONTEXT}
{ENDIF}

## Your Mission

Perform deep analysis of the story and all its tasks:

1. Score story completeness (14 criteria)
2. Score each task completeness (10 criteria per task)
3. Validate story-task alignment
4. Check parent epic goals alignment
5. Compare to sibling stories for consistency
6. Validate progress accuracy
7. Check status consistency

{IF focused}
Prioritize findings related to: {USER_CONTEXT}
{ENDIF}

**Output Format**: Structured markdown with:
- Story completeness score and breakdown
- Task completeness scores (each task)
- Issues found (priority, location, fix)
- Hierarchy validation results
- Progress accuracy analysis
- Recommendations

Execute the analysis now.
```

Store output as `TICKET_QUALITY`.

### 2.2 Invoke specification-quality-checker Agent

Use Task tool (general-purpose) with specification-quality-checker agent in parallel:

```markdown
You are the specification-quality-checker specialized agent. Validate specification clarity.

**Check Type**: full-ticket
**Target**: {STORY_ID}
**Strictness**: strict

**Content to Check**:
{Story README.md content}
{All TASK-*.md content}

## Your Mission

Analyze the story and task specifications for vague/ambiguous language:

1. Detect vague terms in acceptance criteria (handle, support, manage, etc.)
2. Find missing details in technical design (TBD, etc., as needed)
3. Identify implicit assumptions (obviously, clearly, simply)
4. Flag unquantified requirements (fast, efficient, user-friendly)
5. Check BDD scenarios for specificity
6. Verify task steps are concrete (not "implement X")
7. Score agent-executability (can autonomous agent implement this?)

**Output Format**: Markdown report with:
- Ambiguity score per ticket (0-100%, higher is clearer)
- List of vague terms with locations and concrete replacements
- Missing quantifications
- Agent-executability score
- Improvements needed to reach 95%+ clarity

Execute the check now.
```

Store output as `SPECIFICATION_QUALITY`.

### 2.3 Invoke git-state-analyzer Agent (if in-progress)

**Only if MODE == "in-progress"** (commit count > 0):

Use Task tool (general-purpose) with git-state-analyzer agent in parallel:

```markdown
You are the git-state-analyzer specialized agent. Analyze git state and compare to tickets.

**Analysis Type**: ticket-drift
**Branch**: {current branch}
**Ticket Context**: {STORY_ID and path}
**Include uncommitted**: true

## Your Mission

Analyze git commits and file changes, compare to ticket documentation:

1. Parse git commit history (`git log main..HEAD`)
2. Analyze file changes (`git diff main...HEAD --stat`)
3. Extract commit metadata (message, files, author, date)
4. Compare task statuses to commit evidence
5. Detect ticket drift (status mismatch, undocumented changes)
6. Validate progress percentages against reality
7. Identify uncommitted work

**Output Format**: Markdown report with:
- Git activity summary (commits, files, lines changed)
- Task status validation table (ticket vs git)
- Drift items with OLD/NEW proposed fixes
- Progress accuracy analysis
- Uncommitted changes summary

Execute the analysis now.
```

Store output as `GIT_STATE`.

**If MODE == "pre-work":**
- Skip git-state-analyzer
- Set `GIT_STATE = null`

### 2.4 Invoke design-guardian Agent

Use Task tool (general-purpose) with design-guardian agent in parallel:

```markdown
You are the design-guardian specialized agent. Check for overengineering in the story.

**Review Type**: story-review
**Target**: {STORY_ID}
**Context**: {Story user story and description}

**Proposed Work**:
{Story technical design}
{All task checklists}

## Your Mission

Review the story and tasks for unnecessary complexity:

1. Detect premature abstraction (single impl, no roadmap evidence)
2. Flag premature optimization (no metrics showing need)
3. Identify unnecessary caching (small data, CLI tool, rarely accessed)
4. Detect scope creep beyond acceptance criteria
5. Distinguish valid complexity (security, testing, validation) from overengineering

**Output Format**: Markdown with:
- Complexity flags (severity, what, why, simpler alternative)
- Per-task overengineering scores (0-10, lower is simpler)
- Valid complexity justifications
- Recommendations to simplify

Execute the review now.
```

Store output as `COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS`.

### 2.5 Aggregate Agent Results

Wait for all agents to complete, then synthesize:

```markdown
# üìä Story Review Analysis: {STORY_ID}

## Quality Assessment
{From TICKET_QUALITY}

**Story Completeness**: {score}%
**Average Task Completeness**: {avg_score}%
