# Write Next Tickets: Intelligent Ticket Discovery and Creation

You are tasked with discovering incomplete or missing tickets in the project hierarchy and working interactively with the user to write/update them with complete, actionable detail.

## Overall Workflow

1. **Gather User Intent** - Ask if full discovery or specific ticket focus
2. **Discovery & Gap Analysis** - Use Task agent to scan hierarchy and identify gaps
3. **Present Gap Report** - Show findings and get approval on what to work on
4. **Iterative Ticket Writing Loop** - For each ticket to write/update:
   - Present context and current state
   - Interactive Q&A to capture requirements
   - Draft ticket with Task agent
   - Review and refine until approved
   - Save ticket file and update parents
5. **Final Summary** - Report on what was created/updated and next steps

---

## Step 0: Gather User Intent

‚ö†Ô∏è **INITIAL PROMPT**

Before starting discovery, ask the user what scope they want:

```markdown
# üìù Ticket Writing Session

This command helps you discover and write incomplete tickets across the project hierarchy.

**Scope Options:**

1. **full** - Scan entire ticket hierarchy for gaps
   - Analyzes all initiatives, epics, stories
   - Identifies all incomplete or missing tickets
   - Recommends prioritized work order
   - Best for: Planning sessions, new epic work

2. **focused** - Work on specific ticket or area
   - You provide ticket ID or area to focus on
   - Analyzes only that branch of hierarchy
   - Faster, more targeted
   - Best for: Adding stories to existing epic, detailing known gap

**Which scope do you want?** (full/focused)
```

Wait for user response.

**If "full":**
- Set `SCOPE = "full"`
- Set `FOCUS_AREA = ""`
- Proceed to Step 1 with full discovery

**If "focused":**
- Set `SCOPE = "focused"`
- Ask follow-up:
  ```markdown
  **What should we focus on?**

  Provide either:
  - Ticket ID: EPIC-0001.2, STORY-0001.2.1, etc.
  - Area description: "Real indexing epic", "vector search stories", etc.

  Your focus:
  ```

  Wait for user input.
  - If ticket ID: Set `FOCUS_AREA = <ticket_id>`
  - If description: Set `FOCUS_AREA = <description>`
  - Proceed to Step 1 with focused discovery

**If neither:**
- Ask again with validation: "Please choose 'full' or 'focused'"

---

## Step 1: Discovery & Gap Analysis

Use Task agent (general-purpose) to analyze the ticket hierarchy and identify gaps.

### Task Agent Prompt:

```markdown
Perform comprehensive ticket hierarchy analysis to identify incomplete or missing tickets.

**Scope**: {SCOPE}
{IF SCOPE == "focused"}
**Focus Area**: {FOCUS_AREA}
{ENDIF}

## Discovery Mission

Analyze the ticket hierarchy in docs/tickets/ to identify:
1. **Incomplete Tickets** - Exist but lack necessary detail
2. **Missing Tickets** - Should exist based on hierarchy but don't
3. **Readiness Assessment** - Which tickets are ready for work vs need detail
4. **Dependency Mapping** - What must be completed before what

## Required Analysis

### 1. Scan Ticket Hierarchy

**Read All Context:**
1. Roadmap: docs/vision/ROADMAP.md
2. Root CLAUDE.md: CLAUDE.md
3. Tickets CLAUDE.md: docs/tickets/CLAUDE.md
4. All initiatives: docs/tickets/INIT-*/README.md
5. All epics: docs/tickets/INIT-*/EPIC-*/README.md
6. All stories: docs/tickets/INIT-*/EPIC-*/STORY-*/README.md
7. All tasks: docs/tickets/INIT-*/EPIC-*/STORY-*/TASK-*.md

{IF SCOPE == "focused"}
**Focus Your Analysis:**

Only analyze tickets in the focus area and their immediate context:
- If FOCUS_AREA is ticket ID: Read that ticket + parent + children
- If FOCUS_AREA is description: Grep for matching tickets, read those + context

Limit scope to the branch of hierarchy relevant to the focus area.
{ENDIF}

### 2. Codebase Pattern Survey (REQUIRED BEFORE SCORING)

**Before scoring tickets, survey existing patterns to inform recommendations:**

**Discover Existing Patterns:**
1. Read ALL conftest.py files: `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/unit/conftest.py`, `tests/e2e/conftest.py`
   - List all available fixtures
   - Note fixture composition patterns
   - Identify factory fixtures

2. Survey test patterns in `tests/unit/` and `tests/e2e/`
   - Find common AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) patterns
   - Note parametrization strategies
   - Identify reusable step definitions (E2E)
   - Extract mocking approaches

3. Scan source modules in `src/gitctx/`
   - Note common import patterns
   - Identify utility functions and helpers
   - Find shared constants/configuration
   - Document class structures and abstractions

4. Review nested CLAUDE.md files
   - `tests/e2e/CLAUDE.md` - BDD patterns
   - `tests/unit/CLAUDE.md` - TDD patterns
   - `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Documentation standards
   - Note documented anti-patterns to avoid

**Pattern Reuse Checklist:**

When analyzing gaps and recommending work, validate:
- [ ] No new fixture needed when existing one works
- [ ] No duplicate test patterns when similar tests exist
- [ ] No reimplementation of existing utilities
- [ ] No new abstractions when current ones fit
- [ ] No premature optimization without metrics
- [ ] No over-engineering simple problems
- [ ] Stories build on existing foundation

**Output Pattern Inventory** (include in gap analysis):

```markdown
## Discovered Reusable Patterns

**Test Fixtures** ({N} found):
- `fixture_name` (file:line) - {purpose}
- `fixture_name` (file:line) - {purpose}

**Test Patterns** ({N} found):
- AAA pattern: tests/unit/module/test_file.py (lines X-Y)
- Parametrization: tests/unit/module/test_file.py (lines X-Y)
- Factory pattern: tests/unit/conftest.py (lines X-Y)

**Source Patterns** ({N} found):
- Utility: src/gitctx/utils/module.py:function_name
- Helper: src/gitctx/core/module.py:helper_name
- Abstraction: src/gitctx/core/module.py:ClassName

**Documented Anti-Patterns** ({N} found):
- {Anti-pattern from CLAUDE.md}
- {Anti-pattern from CLAUDE.md}

---
```

### 3. Completeness Scoring

For each ticket found, score completeness (0-100%):

#### Initiative Completeness (8 criteria)
- ‚úÖ Has clear strategic objective (not vague)
- ‚úÖ Has measurable key results (not TBD)
- ‚úÖ Has timeline defined (quarters/months)
- ‚úÖ Lists all child epics with links
- ‚úÖ Has success metrics section
- ‚úÖ Has risk assessment
- ‚úÖ Has dependencies documented
- ‚úÖ Progress bar reflects reality

**Score**: N/8 = X%

#### Epic Completeness (10 criteria)
- ‚úÖ Has clear overview (what it delivers)
- ‚úÖ Parent initiative exists and links back
- ‚úÖ Has BDD scenarios (at least 1 key scenario)
- ‚úÖ Lists all child stories with links
- ‚úÖ Has story point estimate
- ‚úÖ Stories sum to epic estimate
- ‚úÖ Has technical approach section
- ‚úÖ Has deliverables checklist
- ‚úÖ No vague terms (TBD, etc., handle, support)
- ‚úÖ Progress bar reflects reality

**Score**: N/10 = X%

#### Story Completeness (14 criteria)
- ‚úÖ Has user story in "As a/I want/So that" format
- ‚úÖ Parent epic exists and links back
- ‚úÖ Has concrete acceptance criteria (testable)
- ‚úÖ Lists all child tasks with links
- ‚úÖ Has BDD scenarios in Gherkin format
- ‚úÖ BDD scenarios cover all acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Has technical design section
- ‚úÖ Has story point estimate
- ‚úÖ Tasks sum to story estimate (1 point ~= 4 hours)
- ‚úÖ Has dependencies section
- ‚úÖ No vague acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Progress bar reflects reality
- ‚úÖ Technical design references existing patterns/fixtures to reuse
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary complexity or premature optimization

**Score**: N/14 = X%

#### Task Completeness (10 criteria)
- ‚úÖ Has clear title (what will be done)
- ‚úÖ Parent story exists and links back
- ‚úÖ Has implementation checklist (concrete steps)
- ‚úÖ Has hour estimate (2-8 hours max)
- ‚úÖ Steps are specific (not "implement X")
- ‚úÖ Includes test requirements
- ‚úÖ Has file paths or module names
- ‚úÖ Has verification criteria
- ‚úÖ Identifies which existing fixtures/patterns to reuse
- ‚úÖ Justifies any new patterns (explains why existing insufficient)

**Score**: N/10 = X%

### 4. Anti-Overengineering Detection

For each incomplete/missing ticket, check for signs of unnecessary complexity:

**Red Flags for Stories/Tasks:**

‚ùå **Unnecessary Abstraction Layers**
- Proposing interfaces/abstractions with only one implementation
- Using "future-proof" without roadmap evidence
- Creating plugin systems before second use case exists

‚ùå **Premature Optimization**
- Caching for small, rarely-accessed data
- Performance tuning before metrics show problems
- Complex algorithms for simple operations

‚ùå **Over-Engineered Solutions**
- Large refactors when targeted fixes work
- Breaking working code "for cleanliness"
- Architectural changes without requirements driving them

‚ùå **Scope Creep**
- Tasks that do more than story requires
- Adding features not in acceptance criteria
- "While we're at it..." syndrome

**Valid Complexity** (DO NOT flag):
‚úÖ Security hardening (always appropriate)
‚úÖ Type safety and validation (catches bugs early)
‚úÖ Error handling for user-facing features
‚úÖ Test coverage improvements
‚úÖ Documentation
‚úÖ Fixing actual quality threshold violations

**When Flagging Overengineering:**

Document:
- Which ticket has unnecessary complexity
- What specific element is over-engineered
- Why it's not needed yet
- What simpler alternative would work
- Under what conditions it would be justified

**Recommendations:**
- Reduce task scope to MVP
- Remove unnecessary task entirely
- Move to future story with "if metrics show need"
- Replace abstraction with concrete implementation

### 5. Gap Classification

Classify each gap found:

**Type 1: Missing Ticket**
- Should exist based on parent but file doesn't exist
- Example: Epic says "3 stories" but only 1 story file exists

**Type 2: Incomplete Detail**
- Ticket exists but score <80%
- Example: Story has no tasks, BDD scenarios missing

**Type 3: Vague Specification**
- Contains TBD, placeholder text, vague terms
- Example: "Handle authentication" (not concrete)

**Type 4: Broken Hierarchy**
- Parent/child links broken or missing
- Example: Story references epic that doesn't exist

**Type 5: Out of Sync**
- Progress bars wrong, status doesn't match reality
- Example: Epic says 50% but all stories complete

**Type 6: Over-Engineered**
- Proposes unnecessary complexity
- Example: Caching layer for data loaded once per process

**Type 7: Pattern Duplication**
- Reimplements existing functionality
- Example: New fixture when existing one works with params

### 6. Dependency Analysis

For each gap, determine:

**Blocking Status:**
- **Ready**: All prerequisites complete, can write now
- **Blocked**: Depends on incomplete work
- **Unknown**: Not enough info to determine

**Blocker Examples:**
- Can't detail EPIC-0002.1 stories until INIT-0001 complete
- Can't write TASK-0001.2.1.3 until STORY-0001.2.1 detailed
- Can write EPIC-0001.2 stories now (EPIC-0001.1 complete)

### 7. Prioritization

Rank gaps by:
1. **Urgency**: On critical path for current work
2. **Readiness**: Not blocked, can work now
3. **Impact**: Enables other work when complete
4. **Completeness**: Closer to ready = higher priority

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0 Critical**: Blocking current development work
- **P1 High**: Needed soon, not blocking yet
- **P2 Medium**: Improves planning, not urgent
- **P3 Low**: Nice to have, can defer

### 8. Roadmap Alignment

Check each gap against docs/vision/ROADMAP.md:
- Does this fit current initiative timeline?
- Is parent initiative in right state for this?
- Does this align with strategic objectives?

**Which gap(s) would you like to work on?**

Provide:
- Gap ID (e.g., GAP-001)
- Multiple IDs (e.g., GAP-001,GAP-002)
- "top" (work recommended order)
- "exit" (stop here)

Your choice:
```

**CRITICAL**: Wait for user response. Do NOT start writing tickets until approved.

**Response Handling:**
- **GAP-ID(s)**: Set `WORK_QUEUE = [gap_ids]`, proceed to Step 3
- **"top"**: Set `WORK_QUEUE = [top 3 from recommended order]`, proceed to Step 3
- **"exit"**: Print summary, exit cleanly
- **Other**: Ask again with validation

4. Save the ticket file
5. Update parent ticket references

Ready to start? (yes/no)
```

Wait for user confirmation. If "no", ask why and address concerns or skip to next gap.

### 3.2 Interactive Requirement Capture

Launch Task agent for interactive Q&A session:

**Task Agent Prompt:**

```markdown
Conduct interactive requirement capture session for {GAP-ID}: {Title}

**Gap Context:**
- Type: {gap_type}
- Ticket ID: {ticket_id or "NEW"}
- Parent: {parent_id}
- Current State: {from gap analysis}
- Missing Details: {from gap analysis}

**Your Mission:**

Work interactively with the user to gather ALL information needed to write a complete, high-quality ticket.

## Interview Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Ask Specific Questions**: Never ask "tell me about X" - ask concrete questions
2. **One Question at a Time**: Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
3. **Build Progressively**: Start high-level, drill into details
4. **Reflect Back**: Summarize what you heard, confirm understanding
5. **Capture Exact Words**: When user provides key terms/concepts, use their language
6. **Probe Vague Responses**: If user says "handle X" or "support Y", ask for specifics
7. **Validate Completeness**: Before finishing, review all criteria for ticket type

### Question Templates by Ticket Type

#### For Initiative Interviews:

**Strategic Questions:**
- "What's the core problem this initiative solves?"
- "What does success look like? How would we measure it?"
- "What's the timeline? When should this be complete?"
- "What are the 3-5 key results we must achieve?"

**Scope Questions:**
- "What epics make up this initiative? Can you name them?"
- "For each epic, what's the one-sentence description?"
- "What's explicitly out of scope for this initiative?"

**Dependency Questions:**
- "What must be true before we start this initiative?"
- "What other initiatives or work does this depend on?"
- "What risks could derail this?"

#### For Epic Interviews:

**Overview Questions:**
- "In 2-3 sentences, what does this epic deliver?"
- "Who's the primary user/beneficiary?"
- "What's the key behavior change this enables?"

**BDD Questions:**
- "What's the most important scenario this epic enables?"
- "Walk me through: Given [setup], when [user does X], what should happen?"
- "What are 2-3 edge cases we need to handle?"

**Breakdown Questions:**
- "What are the main stories in this epic? (aim for 3-5)"
- "For each story, what's the user-facing value?"
- "How many story points for each? (Fibonacci: 1,2,3,5,8,13)"

**Technical Questions:**
- "What's the technical approach? Any key technologies?"
- "What are the major technical risks?"
- "Are there any external dependencies (APIs, services)?"

#### For Story Interviews:

**User Story Questions:**
- "As a [who?], I want [what?], so that [why?]"
- "Let's refine: Who specifically is this for?"
- "What's the core action they want to take?"
- "What value do they get from this?"

**Acceptance Criteria Questions:**
- "How will we know this story is complete? List criteria."
- "For each criterion, how would we test it?"
- "What should NOT happen? (negative criteria)"

**BDD Scenario Questions:**
- "Let's write scenarios. First one: Given [what setup?]"
- "When the user does [what action?]"
- "Then what should happen? Be specific about output/state."
- "Any other scenarios? (happy path, error cases, edge cases)"

**Task Breakdown Questions:**
- "What are the implementation steps? (aim for 3-7 tasks)"
- "For each task, what's the deliverable?"
- "How many hours for each task? (2-8 hours max per task)"

**Technical Design Questions:**
- "What files/modules will be created or modified?"
- "What's the data model or key types?"
- "How will this be tested? (unit, integration, e2e)"
- "Are there existing patterns we should follow?"
- "What existing fixtures/helpers can we reuse?"

**Pattern Reuse Questions:**
- "I found fixture `{name}` that does {X}. Can we use that instead of creating new?"
- "There's a similar test in `{file}`. Should we follow the same pattern?"
- "Do we need {proposed abstraction} now, or can we start simpler?"
- "Is this optimization necessary, or should we wait for metrics?"

#### For Task Interviews:

**Implementation Questions:**
- "What are the concrete steps to implement this?"
- "For each step, which file(s) are affected?"
- "What test files will be created/modified?"

**Estimate Questions:**
- "How many hours for this task? (be specific)"
- "What could make this take longer?"
- "Are there unknowns we need to research first?"

**Verification Questions:**
- "How will we verify this task is done?"
- "What command would we run to test it?"
- "What should the output/behavior be?"

### Interview Flow

1. **Introduce**: "I'm going to ask you questions to gather complete requirements for {ticket}."

2. **Start High-Level**: Ask strategic/overview questions first

3. **Drill Down**: Based on answers, ask follow-up questions for details

4. **Probe Vagueness**: If answer contains vague terms:
   - "You mentioned 'handle authentication' - can you be more specific?"
   - "What exactly should happen when..."
   - "Can you give me an example?"

5. **Summarize**: After each section, reflect back:
   - "Let me make sure I understand: [summary]. Is that right?"

6. **Check Completeness**: Before finishing:
   - "Let's review the {initiative|epic|story|task} criteria..."
   - "We have: {list what's captured}"
   - "Still need: {list what's missing}"

7. **Final Confirmation**:
   - "I think I have everything. Let me draft the ticket and show you."

3. **Preserve Language**: Use user's terms, not generic descriptions
4. **Validate Understanding**: Reflect back frequently
5. **Check Criteria**: Ensure all completeness criteria will be met
6. **Note Unknowns**: If user says "I don't know", note it for follow-up

**Conduct the interview now.**
```

**Agent Configuration:**
- Type: general-purpose
- Mode: Interactive (ask questions, wait for responses)
- Output: Captured requirements in structured format

**Monitor Interview:**
- Let agent lead the questions
- User provides answers
- Agent builds up requirements
- Agent signals when ready to draft

### 3.3 Draft Ticket with Task Agent

After requirements captured, launch another Task agent to draft the ticket:

**Task Agent Prompt:**

```markdown
Draft a complete, high-quality ticket for {TICKET-ID} based on captured requirements.

**Ticket Type**: {Initiative | Epic | Story | Task}
**Ticket ID**: {ID or "NEW - assign next sequential"}
**Parent**: {parent_id}

**Captured Requirements:**

{Full output from interview agent}

**Your Mission:**

Write a complete ticket file that:
1. Follows the template from docs/tickets/CLAUDE.md
2. Includes ALL captured information
3. Meets 100% of completeness criteria for ticket type
4. Uses clear, specific language (no vague terms)
5. Has correct file structure and formatting
6. Includes proper parent/child links

## Drafting Guidelines

### File Naming and Path

**Determine Ticket ID:**
{IF new ticket}
- Look at existing tickets in parent directory
- Assign next sequential number
- Example: If STORY-0001.2.1, STORY-0001.2.2 exist, new one is STORY-0001.2.3
{ELSE}
- Use existing ticket ID: {ticket_id}
{ENDIF}

**Determine File Path:**
- Initiative: docs/tickets/INIT-{NNNN}/README.md
- Epic: docs/tickets/INIT-{NNNN}/EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/README.md
- Story: docs/tickets/INIT-{NNNN}/EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/STORY-{NNNN}.{E}.{S}/README.md
- Task: docs/tickets/INIT-{NNNN}/EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/STORY-{NNNN}.{E}.{S}/TASK-{NNNN}.{E}.{S}.{T}.md

## Content Quality Rules

1. **No Vague Terms**: Replace with specifics
   - ‚ùå "Handle authentication"
   - ‚úÖ "Validate JWT tokens and return 401 for expired tokens"

2. **Concrete Acceptance Criteria**: Must be testable
   - ‚ùå "System should be fast"
   - ‚úÖ "Search returns results in <2 seconds for 10K files"

3. **Specific BDD Scenarios**: Exact inputs/outputs
   - ‚ùå "When user searches, Then show results"
   - ‚úÖ "When I search 'auth', Then display ‚â•3 results with file:line format"

4. **Detailed Steps**: File paths, not vague actions
   - ‚ùå "Implement the feature"
   - ‚úÖ "Create src/gitctx/auth.py with validate_token() function"

5. **Realistic Estimates**: Based on scope
   - Tasks: 2-8 hours max
   - Stories: 1-13 points (Fibonacci)
   - Epics: Sum of stories

6. **Proper Links**: Use relative paths correctly
   - Parent: ../README.md or ../../README.md
   - Children: STORY-*/README.md or TASK-*.md

7. **Progress Bars**: Use ‚ñà and ‚ñë characters
   - 10 chars total: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë = 40%

Your choice:
```

**CRITICAL**: Wait for user response.

**Response Handling:**

**If "approve":**
- Proceed to 3.5 (save ticket)

**If "revise":**
- Ask: "What needs to change?"
- User describes changes
- Either:
  - Make edits directly (if small changes)

**If "skip":**
- Don't save ticket
- Mark gap as skipped
- Continue to next gap in queue

**If "show-full":**
- Display complete ticket content
- Ask for review choice again

### 3.5 Save Ticket File

**Only proceed if user approved draft.**

#### 3.5.1 Determine Action

```python
if ticket_file_exists:
    action = "Edit"
    # Use Edit tool to update existing file
else:
    action = "Write"
    # Use Write tool to create new file
    # May need to create parent directory first
```

#### 3.5.2 Create Directory if Needed

```bash
# Example for new story
# If creating STORY-0001.2.1, need directory:
# docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.2/STORY-0001.2.1/

{IF new story or epic}
# Check if directory exists
ls docs/tickets/INIT-{NNNN}/EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/STORY-{NNNN}.{E}.{S}/

{IF doesn't exist}
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p docs/tickets/INIT-{NNNN}/EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/STORY-{NNNN}.{E}.{S}/
{ENDIF}
{ENDIF}
```

#### 3.5.3 Write/Edit Ticket File

```python
{IF action == "Write"}
# Use Write tool
Write(
    file_path="{absolute_path_to_ticket_file}",
    content="{full_ticket_content_from_draft}"
)
{ELSE}
# Use Edit tool
# Replace entire file content
Edit(
    file_path="{absolute_path_to_ticket_file}",
    old_string="{entire_current_content}",
    new_string="{full_ticket_content_from_draft}"
)
{ENDIF}
```

#### 3.5.4 Verify Save

```bash
# Verify file exists
ls -la {file_path}

# Show file size
wc -l {file_path}
```

Output:
```markdown
‚úÖ Saved: {TICKET-ID}

File: {file_path}
Size: {N} lines
Action: {Created new file | Updated existing file}
```

### 3.6 Update Parent Ticket

**If ticket has parent, update parent to reference new/updated child.**

#### Find Parent File

```python
# Examples:
# If wrote STORY-0001.2.1, parent is EPIC-0001.2/README.md
# If wrote EPIC-0001.2, parent is INIT-0001/README.md
# If wrote TASK-0001.2.1.3, parent is STORY-0001.2.1/README.md
```

#### Read Parent

```python
Read(file_path="{parent_readme_path}")
```

#### Update Parent

Depending on ticket type:

**If added/updated Epic:**
```markdown
# Update initiative's epic table

OLD:
| [EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}](EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/README.md) | {Old Title} | {Old Status} | {Old Progress} | - |

NEW:
| [EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}](EPIC-{NNNN}.{E}/README.md) | {New Title} | üîµ Not Started | ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0% | - |
```

Or if new epic:
```markdown
OLD:
{Last epic row in table}

NEW:
{Last epic row in table}
| [EPIC-{NNNN}.{NEW}](EPIC-{NNNN}.{NEW}/README.md) | {Title} | üîµ | ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 0% | - |
```

**If added/updated Story:**
```markdown
# Update epic's story table

OLD:
{last story row or specific story row}

NEW:
{updated story row or new story row}
```

**If added/updated Task:**
```markdown
# Update story's task table

OLD:
{last task row or specific task row}

NEW:
{updated task row or new task row}
```

#### Save Parent Update

```python
Edit(
    file_path="{parent_readme_path}",
    old_string="{specific section to update}",
    new_string="{updated section}"
)
```

Verify:
```markdown
‚úÖ Updated parent: {PARENT-ID}

File: {parent_path}
Change: Added/updated reference to {TICKET-ID}
```

### 3.7 Mark Gap Complete

Update TodoWrite to mark this gap complete:

```python
TodoWrite(
    todos=[
        {
            "content": "GAP-{ID}: {title}",
            "status": "completed",
            "activeForm": "Completed GAP-{ID}"
        },
        # ... other gaps still pending/in_progress
    ]
)
```

### 3.8 Loop to Next Gap

```markdown
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

‚úÖ Completed: {GAP-ID} - {TICKET-ID}

**Created/Updated**: {file_path}
**Parent Updated**: {parent_path}

{IF more gaps in queue}
---

**Next in queue**: {NEXT-GAP-ID} - {title}

Continue? (yes/no/defer)

- **yes**: Start next gap now
- **no**: Stop here, exit session
- **defer**: Show remaining queue, let me choose

{ELSE}
---

**All selected gaps complete!** üéâ

Proceeding to final summary...
{ENDIF}
```

If user says "yes", loop back to 3.1 for next gap.
If user says "no", go to Step 4 (final summary).

```markdown
‚úÖ Ticket Hierarchy Complete!

**Analysis**: Scanned {N} tickets across {N} initiatives.

**Findings**:
- All initiatives have detailed epics
- All epics have complete stories
- All stories have defined tasks
- All BDD scenarios present
- No vague specifications found

**Quality Score**: {avg}% average completeness

**Your ticket hierarchy is in excellent shape!** üéâ

Next steps:
- Review current work with `/review-story`
- Start next task with `/start-next-task`
- Monitor progress in ROADMAP.md
```

Exit successfully.

### Error: User Exits During Interview

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Interview Incomplete

**Gap**: {GAP-ID}
**Progress**: Captured {N} of {total} required details
**Saved**: No (interview not complete)

**Partial Requirements Captured**:
{show what was captured}

You can:
- Run `/write-next-tickets focused` on {GAP-ID} to resume
- Start fresh with different gap
- Review what was captured above and continue manually

Session paused. No files were modified.
```

Exit cleanly.

### Error: Draft Quality Too Low

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Draft Quality Below Threshold

**Ticket**: {TICKET-ID}
**Completeness**: {score}% (minimum: 80%)

**Missing**:
- {Missing item 1}
- {Missing item 2}

**Options**:
1. **revise**: Go back and fill in missing details
2. **save-anyway**: Save as-is (not recommended)
3. **skip**: Don't save, move to next gap

Choice:
```

If user chooses "save-anyway", warn:
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Saving incomplete ticket

This ticket will need more detail before it's ready for work.
You'll need to update it later with:
{list missing items}

Confirm save anyway? (yes/no)
```

Only save if user confirms "yes".

### Error: Parent Ticket Not Found

```markdown
‚úó Parent ticket not found

**Ticket to Create**: {TICKET-ID}
**Expected Parent**: {PARENT-ID}
**Parent Path**: {path}
**Status**: File does not exist

**This is a hierarchy error.**

You must create parent ticket first:
1. Run `/write-next-tickets focused` on {PARENT-ID}
2. Create/update parent ticket
3. Then retry creating {TICKET-ID}

Or:
1. Check if parent ID is correct
2. Update the hierarchy structure
3. Retry

Session paused. No files were modified for this gap.
```

Skip to next gap or exit.

## Implementation Notes

### Agent Coordination

**Agent 1: Discovery (Step 1)**
- Type: general-purpose
- Mode: Research (read-only)
- Input: Ticket hierarchy, roadmap, CLAUDE.md files
- Output: Gap analysis report
- Duration: 2-5 minutes depending on scope

**Agent 2: Interview (Step 3.2)**
- Type: general-purpose
- Mode: Interactive (ask questions, wait for responses)
- Input: Gap context, ticket templates
- Output: Captured requirements
- Duration: 5-30 minutes depending on ticket complexity

**Agent 3: Drafting (Step 3.3)**
- Type: general-purpose
- Mode: Research (generating content)
- Input: Captured requirements, templates
- Output: Complete ticket draft
- Duration: 1-2 minutes

### State Tracking

Use TodoWrite throughout:
```python
# After Step 2 (present gaps)
todos = [
    {"content": f"GAP-{id}: {title}", "status": "pending", "activeForm": f"Working on GAP-{id}"}
    for id, title in gaps_to_work_on
]

# During Step 3 (processing)
# Mark current as in_progress, others as pending
# Mark completed as completed

# After Step 4 (summary)
# Clear all todos (session complete)
```

### File Operations

**Creating Directories:**
```bash
mkdir -p docs/tickets/INIT-{N}/EPIC-{N}.{E}/STORY-{N}.{E}.{S}/
```

**Writing New Tickets:**
```python
Write(
    file_path="/absolute/path/to/ticket.md",
    content="# TICKET-ID: Title\n\n..."
)
```

**Updating Existing Tickets:**
```python
# Read first
content = Read(file_path="...")

# Edit with specific OLD/NEW
Edit(
    file_path="...",
    old_string="exact text to replace",
    new_string="new text"
)
```

### Quality Validation

Before saving any ticket, verify:
- Completeness score ‚â•80% (or get user confirmation)
- No vague terms (TBD, handle, support, etc.)
- All acceptance criteria testable
- BDD scenarios use proper Gherkin format
- Parent/child links are correct
- Estimates are realistic
- File path is correct

### Interview Best Practices

**Good Questions:**
- "What's the core problem this solves?"
- "How will we test this criterion?"
- "What should happen when the user clicks submit?"

**Bad Questions:**
- "Tell me about this feature." (too vague)
- "What do you want?" (too open-ended)
- "Anything else?" (lazy)

**Probing Vagueness:**
- User: "It should handle errors"
- Agent: "What specific errors? What should happen for each error type?"

**Building Progressively:**
1. High-level: What/why
2. Mid-level: Who/when
3. Detail: How/specifics
4. Verify: Test cases/edge cases

### Markdown Formatting

**Progress Bars** (10 chars):
- 0%: ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
- 50%: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë
- 100%: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà

**Status Indicators**:
- üîµ Not Started
- üü° In Progress
- ‚úÖ Complete
- üî¥ Blocked

**Tables**: Use pipe format with header separator

**Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks with language
