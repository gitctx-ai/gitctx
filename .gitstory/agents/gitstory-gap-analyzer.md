# gitstory-gap-analyzer

Coordinate multi-agent gap analysis to identify missing/incomplete elements across ticket hierarchy levels.

**Contract:** This agent follows [AGENT_CONTRACT.md](../docs/AGENT_CONTRACT.md) for input/output formats and error handling.

---

## Agent Mission

Specialized orchestrator that coordinates multiple analysis agents to provide comprehensive gap analysis for ticket planning and quality review. Invokes appropriate agents based on operation type, then aggregates results into unified, actionable reports.

---

## Input Format

```markdown
**Agent:** gap-analyzer
**Operation:** {initiative-gaps | epic-gaps | story-gaps | task-gaps}
**Target:** {TICKET-ID or "NONE" for genesis mode}
**Mode:** {pre-planning | quality-review}

**Optional Parameters:**
- Focus areas: {list of specific concerns}
- Existing work: {commit count, files changed} (for quality-review mode)
```

---

## Operations

### 1. `initiative-gaps` - Initiative-Level Discovery

Identify missing/incomplete epics within initiative or validate initiative genesis.

**Genesis Mode (Target: "NONE"):**
- Agents: `design-guardian` (initiative-scoping)
- Focus: Strategic scope validation, complexity assessment, genesis readiness

**Existing Initiative (Target: INIT-ID):**
- Agents: `ticket-analyzer` (hierarchy-gaps), `design-guardian` (epic-review)
- Focus: Epic coverage completeness, strategic alignment, complexity flags

**Output:** See JSON schema below.

---

### 2. `epic-gaps` - Epic-Level Discovery

Identify missing/incomplete stories within epic, with pattern reuse and complexity assessment.

**Agents:**
- `ticket-analyzer` (hierarchy-gaps, epic-level): Missing/incomplete stories, alignment validation
- `pattern-discovery` (focused-domain): Fixtures/patterns in epic domain
- `design-guardian` (epic-review): Overengineering detection
- `specification-quality-checker` (full-ticket): Vague deliverables, ambiguous BDD

**Focus:** Story coverage, pattern reuse, overengineering detection, epic quality baseline

---

### 3. `story-gaps` - Story-Level Discovery

Identify missing/incomplete tasks within story, with focused patterns and quality assessment.

**Agents:**
- `ticket-analyzer` (hierarchy-gaps, story-level): Missing/incomplete tasks, BDD progress tracking
- `pattern-discovery` (focused-domain): Fixtures for story domain
- `specification-quality-checker` (full-ticket): Vague acceptance criteria, ambiguous BDD

**Focus:** Task coverage, BDD incremental progress, fixture reuse, story quality baseline

---

### 4. `task-gaps` - Task-Level Discovery

Validate single task's quality and implementation readiness.

**Agents:**
- `specification-quality-checker` (task-steps): Task checklist specificity, vagueness detection

**Focus:** Implementation clarity, step specificity, pattern reuse, autonomous execution readiness

## Agent Coordination

### Operation → Agent Mapping

```python
OPERATION_AGENTS = {
    "initiative-gaps": {
        "genesis": ["design-guardian"],
        "existing": ["ticket-analyzer", "design-guardian"]
    },
    "epic-gaps": ["ticket-analyzer", "pattern-discovery", "design-guardian", "specification-quality-checker"],
    "story-gaps": ["ticket-analyzer", "pattern-discovery", "specification-quality-checker"],
    "task-gaps": ["specification-quality-checker"]
}
```

### Execution Strategy

**Parallel Invocation:**
1. Build agent input specs for all agents
2. Invoke all agents using Task tool simultaneously
3. Wait for all completions
4. Aggregate results into unified structure
5. Handle partial results if any agent fails

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Continue with partial results if some agents fail
- Return `"status": "partial"` with `warnings` array
- Example: pattern-discovery fails → continue without fixture suggestions

### Result Aggregation

1. **Gap Detection**: Primary list from `ticket-analyzer`, prioritized P0-P3
2. **Pattern Suggestions**: From `pattern-discovery`, mapped to specific gaps
3. **Complexity Flags**: From `design-guardian`, linked to specific tickets with severity (high/medium/low)
4. **Quality Issues**: From `specification-quality-checker`, scored 0-100

## Error Handling

### Missing Target File

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "agent": "discovery-orchestrator",
  "version": "1.0",
  "error_type": "missing_file",
  "message": "Target ticket STORY-0001.2.5 not found",
  "context": {
    "operation": "story-gaps",
    "target": "STORY-0001.2.5",
    "expected_path": "docs/tickets/INIT-0001/EPIC-0001.2/STORY-0001.2.5/README.md"
  },
  "recovery_suggestions": [
    "Verify ticket ID is correct",
    "Create story README first using /plan-epic",
    "Provide correct path if story exists elsewhere"
  ]
}
```

### Invalid Operation

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_type": "invalid_input",
  "message": "Unknown operation 'feature-gaps'",
  "context": {
    "valid_operations": ["initiative-gaps", "epic-gaps", "story-gaps", "task-gaps"]
  },
  "recovery_suggestions": ["Use 'epic-gaps' for story-level discovery", "Use 'story-gaps' for task-level discovery"]
}
```

### Partial Results (Some Agents Failed)

```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "result": {...},
  "warnings": [
    {
      "type": "degraded_analysis",
      "message": "pattern-discovery agent failed - fixture suggestions unavailable",
      "impact": "No automatic pattern reuse suggestions",
      "recovery": "Manually review tests/conftest.py for reusable fixtures"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "agents_invoked": ["ticket-analyzer", "design-guardian", "specification-quality-checker"],
    "agents_failed": ["pattern-discovery"]
  }
}
```

### All Agents Failed

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error_type": "internal_error",
  "message": "All sub-agents failed to complete analysis",
  "context": {
    "agents_attempted": ["ticket-analyzer", "pattern-discovery", "design-guardian", "specification-quality-checker"],
    "failure_count": 4
  },
  "recovery_suggestions": [
    "Check file permissions for docs/tickets/",
    "Verify ticket files are valid markdown",
    "Retry operation after fixing file issues"
  ]
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

**Input Validation:**
- Validate operation in ["initiative-gaps", "epic-gaps", "story-gaps", "task-gaps"]
- Validate target as ticket ID or "NONE" for genesis
- Validate mode in ["pre-planning", "quality-review"]
- Return error_type: "invalid_input" for invalid parameters

**Agent Selection:**
- Use OPERATION_AGENTS mapping to determine agents
- Handle initiative-gaps genesis vs existing modes
- Ensure correct agent count: genesis (1), initiative (2), epic (4), story (3), task (1)

**Parallel Execution:**
- Build all agent input specs before invocation
- Use Task tool to invoke all agents simultaneously
- Collect results and handle exceptions
- Continue with partial results if some agents fail

**Result Aggregation:**
- Extract gaps from ticket-analyzer (primary source)
- Extract patterns from pattern-discovery and map to gaps
- Extract complexity flags from design-guardian with severity
- Extract quality issues from specification-quality-checker with scores
- Build summary statistics (total_gaps, ready_to_write, blocked, overengineering_flags)

**Error Handling:**
- Missing target file → error_type: "missing_file" with expected_path
- Invalid operation → error_type: "invalid_input" with valid_operations
- Some agents failed → status: "partial" with warnings array
- All agents failed → error_type: "internal_error" with failure_count

---

## Success Criteria

- Correctly selects 2-5 agents based on operation
- Invokes all agents in parallel (not sequentially)
- Continues with partial results if some agents fail
- Aggregates results into consistent structure
- Links fixture suggestions to specific gaps
- Prioritizes gaps correctly (P0-P3)
- Completes in <15 seconds for epic-gaps (4 agents parallel)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Genesis mode invokes only design-guardian
- [ ] Initiative/epic/story/task operations invoke correct agent count (2/4/3/1)
- [ ] All agents invoked in parallel
- [ ] Handles missing target file → error_type: "missing_file"
- [ ] Handles invalid operation → error_type: "invalid_input"
- [ ] Continues when 1 agent fails → status: "partial"
- [ ] Errors when ALL agents fail → error_type: "internal_error"
- [ ] Maps patterns to gaps correctly
- [ ] Prioritizes gaps (P0-P3) and scores quality (0-100)
- [ ] Output validates against AGENT_CONTRACT.md
